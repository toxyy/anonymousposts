## Requirements

phpBB 3.3.5-RC1+ PHP 7+

## Features

Post anonymously in topics as a user.  All user information is hidden from users, except to staff, who have a special view.

All places the former username would appear are replaced, including the topic review, forumrow, topicrow, and
postrow, even in search.php pages.  Quotes are supported as well.

Users will receive notifications to their anonymous posts.

Friends and foes have no impact on anonymous posts.

Forum and user (including group) permissions are available in the ACP.  Permit individual groups
and users to be able to post anonymously, in whatever forums you've permitted to allow
anonymous posts.

Turkish language supported, all styles should be supported.
